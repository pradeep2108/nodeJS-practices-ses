A framework simply abstracts the lower level code allowing to focus on the requirements than the code itself  

Angular, React, Vue are all framework/libraries that help you build user interfaces without having to rely on the lower level DOM API in javascript 

There are frameworks to build web or mobile applications without having to rely on the HTTP module in node.js 

Ex: express, nest, hapi, koa and sails 

They build on top of the HTTP module making it easier for you to implement all the features
